# Consumer Trend Forecasting — MVP

**Outcome:** 5-year genre forecasts with confidence bands and a Hype Index (Google Trends) to show how audience interest shifts the outlook. One-page dashboard, accuracy table, and executive brief.

**Decisions answered:** Top-3 rising genres; confidence (High/Med/Low); impact of hype vs. history-only.

## Status

- ✅ Hour 1/7 complete — framing & scaffolding done
- ✅ IMDb base: `genre_year_agg.csv` created (1980–2020)
- ✅ Hype Index (Google Trends): 12 monthly CSVs exported and consolidated
  - Monthly → `data/processed/hype_index_monthly.csv`
  - Annual  → `data/processed/hype_index_annual.csv`
- ▶ With-sentiment subset selected: Sci-Fi, Thriller, Action, Drama, Horror, Romance

**Next visible milestone:** Baseline 5-year forecasts from IMDb history (`forecast_baseline.csv`) with uncertainty bands.

# **The Story** 

This repository contains an MVP for Netflix-style consumer trend forecasting: a compact, decision-focused data product that estimates what audiences are likely to lean into next by combining historical supply (an IMDb-like corpus aggregated to annual genre counts, 1980–2020) with a real-time interest signal (“Hype Index”) derived from Google Trends (2010–present). The pipeline cleans and aggregates the movie/TV dataset to genre × year title counts; curates simple, unambiguous query terms per genre; downloads monthly Google Trends indexes; normalizes and smooths them; and annualizes to align with the historical series. Two forecasting perspectives are produced for 2021–2025: a history-only baseline and a with-sentiment variant that uses a lightweight Ridge AR(1) with exogenous hype and a trend term (chosen for robustness on short/sparse series). From those forecasts the project computes interpretable summary metrics—mean forecast (yhat), uncertainty bands, symmetric uplift percentage bounded between −200% and +200% to avoid “infinite uplift” when baselines are near zero, absolute delta (avg\_with − avg\_baseline), CAGR across the horizon, relative band width as a confidence proxy, and a simple backtest MAPE on a 2016–2020 holdout for a few representative genres. The artifacts are committed under `data/processed/` for hosting: `genre_year_agg.csv`, `hype_index_monthly.csv`, `hype_index_annual.csv`, `forecast_baseline.csv`, `forecast_with_sentiment.csv`, `forecast_joined.csv`, and `insights_genre.csv`. The interactive front end is a Streamlit + Plotly dashboard (`app/dashboard/streamlit_app.py`) that loads these CSVs directly from the repo and provides: a Top Genres overview by average with-sentiment forecast; an Uplift vs Baseline bar (symmetric % with tooltips that surface absolute deltas when the baseline is sparse); a Forecast Explorer with ribbons and optional baseline comparison; a Year × Genre heatmap; filters for genres/years/variant/confidence; and one-click downloads of the underlying tables. To run locally: create a virtual environment, activate it, then `pip install -r requirements.txt` (the file is intentionally minimal: `streamlit>=1.36`, `plotly>=5.22`, `pandas>=2.1,<2.4`, `numpy>=1.26,<2.4`), and launch with `streamlit run app/dashboard/streamlit_app.py` (or `python -m streamlit run app/dashboard/streamlit_app.py`). If you wish to reproduce the artifacts instead of using the committed CSVs, run the scripts in `app/et1/` in order: `build_hype_index.py` (creates annual and monthly hype index), `build_baseline_forecast.py` (history-only), `build_with_sentiment_forecast_ridge.py` (with-sentiment), and `build_insights.py` (joins, computes metrics, and writes `insights_genre.csv`). For deployment, this repository is configured to work out-of-the-box on Render as a single web service (no separate backend needed) with build command `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt` and start command `streamlit run app/dashboard/streamlit_app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0`; set `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9` and optionally `STREAMLIT_BROWSER_GATHERUSAGESTATS=false`, and ensure `data/processed/*.csv` are committed (Linux is case-sensitive; if a `.gitignore` blocks CSVs, append `!data/processed/*.csv`). Interpreting results: yhat is the expected level within the dataset scope (not global production totals); bands reflect forecast uncertainty; symmetric uplift compares with-sentiment to baseline in a bounded way; absolute delta is the most honest magnitude signal when baseline is near zero; CAGR summarizes directional strength over the horizon; relative band width is a compact confidence proxy; and the backtest MAPE is a lightweight quality check rather than a full evaluation suite. Known limitations and ethics: Google Trends interest is a proxy (search ≠ viewing), terms can be ambiguous, and global interest mixes regions; this MVP is directional and portfolio-oriented, not a greenlight tool. Roadmap directions include regional models (US/India/EU) with localized query sets, richer social signals (YouTube/Reddit) as additional exogenous drivers, stronger validation (cross-validation and alternative baselines), a small FastAPI JSON layer for `/insights` and `/forecast` endpoints, and optional theme polish (a Netflix-inspired dark palette).
