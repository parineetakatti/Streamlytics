# Netflix Project — Decision Framing (MVP)

## Problem (short)
Studios and streamers invest heavily in content without a clear forward view of which genres will grow in the next 3–5 years. Historical genre cycles (romcoms → superheroes → sci-fi/thriller) show tastes shift; budgets need a data-driven, explainable forecast.

## Decisions this MVP answers
1) Which **Top-3 genres** are rising for the next 3–5 years?
2) What is the **confidence** per genre (High / Medium / Low)?
3) How does a **Hype Index** (audience interest) change the outlook vs. history-only?

## Non-Goals (MVP)
• Title-level recommendations • Causal inference • Revenue prediction
